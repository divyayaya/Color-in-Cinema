# Color in Cinema
Image processing for determining color palettes in movies

## Concept
We can ana­lyze the dom­in­ant col­or in each frame to de­term­ine the film's visu­al style. By as­so­ci­at­ing the fre­quency of col­ors with their hue, sat­ur­a­tion, and bright­ness, we can bet­ter un­der­stand how emo­tions evolve in the film over time.
